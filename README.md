# Gesture_control_device
This Project is made using Firmata API and opencv to make a Gesture control device using Arduino.  
This uses An array of ultrasonic sensors to detect the hand movement over the sensor array to perform different operations like..  
  
1.Page previous  
2.Page next  
3.Volume Up  
4.Volume Down  
5.ScreenShot  
6.Pause/play   
  
Can intelligently avoid collision between different gesture patterns.
